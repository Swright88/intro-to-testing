** Please note this will be tested using the Miro Web version.

// How easy is it to create a board to start with when accessing the page?
// What are the initial steps after you access the page? ie. does it require sign in or can you jump straight into creating a FLowchart board?
// If you need to sign up initiall, how easy is it to do so?
// How easy is it to use?
// Is it initially obvious what to do and how to access features such as adding text, or adding a box to the board?
// Is it easy to invite/share with others, your Miro board?
